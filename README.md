<h1>Building my Own SHELL</h1>
# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your `shell` implementation is in `app/main.c`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `c (9.2)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.c`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
